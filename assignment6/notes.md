This article builds upon pronouncements from some AI pioneers that "computers plus humans do better than either one alone”

Humans are regarded to be able to offer more holistic and intuitive approaches when it comes to uncertainty. Whilst AI with the correct supervision can prove very effective. 

To give a background of the subject of AI, the author defines it broadly as "intelligent systems with the ability to think and learn". Also, IBM Watson is introduced, which is a AI able to win over human contestants in the famous game of jepoardy. Watson is able to, using Natural language processing, understand sentences and answer questions. It is able to learn from past experiences and interaction using machine learning and finally it has access to large databases of information. Systems of similar design are able to help doctors diagnose patients from MRI-images. 

These results have long troubled pundits within Artificial Intellegence. Elon Musk recently noted that AI will take over most human jobs. However, this has been a long standing non fulfilling prophecy, in 1970 Marvin Minsky, a scientist at MIT had the following to say about AI:

    "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being ... able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, and have a fight. At that point, the machine will begin to educate itself with fantastic speed. In a few months, it will be at genius level and a few months after that its powers will be incalculable.“

The article mentions people opposing this notion and the article aims to highlight the opinion of some AI-researches that:

    "computers plus humans do better than either one alone"

It is known that some analytical tasks the computer has already surpassed humans. Arithmetic was a battle never worth figthing but a very important moment was when the computer surpassed humans in chess, DeepBlue vs Kasparov. Alhough perhaps not applicable to managerial decision-making (as tasks are more uncertain and not open-info as in chess), the idea of AI became fascinating. Optimal chess players were described as part-human part-computer where both parts offer complementary capabilities needed for effective decision-making.

It proves effective to work in symbosis, a recent study showed that when identifying cancerous lymph node cells in images the collaboration between humans and AI lead to a correct detection of 99.5% of cases, whereas induvidually they had an accuracy of 96.5% and 92.5% respectively. 


## Applying symbosis to managerial desicions...


How can this improvements be leveraged in managerial decision-making? 

Some managers are reluctant to use AI systems to aid them in decision making is that they fear it might replace humans. It outlines 3 different aspects of decision making, uncertainty, complexity and equivocality. Further they make a distinction between analytical and intuitive decision making.

### Analytical 


### Intuitive


### uncertainty 

### complexity

###  equivocality
