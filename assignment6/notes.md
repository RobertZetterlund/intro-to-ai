This article builds upon pronouncements from some AI pioneers that "computers plus humans do better than either one alone”

Humans are regarded to be able to offer more holistic and intuitive approaches when it comes to uncertainty. Whilst AI with the correct supervision can prove very effective. 

To give a background of the subject of AI, the author defines it broadly as "intelligent systems with the ability to think and learn". Also, IBM Watson is introduced, which is a AI able to win over human contestants in the famous game of jepoardy. Watson is able to, using Natural language processing, understand sentences and answer questions. It is able to learn from past experiences and interaction using machine learning and finally it has access to large databases of information. Systems of similar design are able to help doctors diagnose patients from MRI-images. 

These results have long troubled pundits within Artificial Intellegence. Elon Musk recently noted that AI will take over most human jobs. However, this has been a long standing non fulfilling prophecy, in 1970 Marvin Minsky, a scientist at MIT had the following to say about AI:

    "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being ... able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, and have a fight. At that point, the machine will begin to educate itself with fantastic speed. In a few months, it will be at genius level and a few months after that its powers will be incalculable.“

The article mentions people opposing this notion and the article aims to highlight the opinion of some AI-researches that:

    "computers plus humans do better than either one alone"

It is known that some analytical tasks the computer has already surpassed humans. Arithmetic was a battle never worth figthing but a very important moment was when the computer surpassed humans in chess, DeepBlue vs Kasparov. Alhough perhaps not applicable to managerial decision-making (as tasks are more uncertain and not open-info as in chess), the idea of AI became fascinating. Optimal chess players were described as part-human part-computer where both parts offer complementary capabilities needed for effective decision-making.

It proves effective to work in symbosis, a recent study showed that when identifying cancerous lymph node cells in images the collaboration between humans and AI lead to a correct detection of 99.5% of cases, whereas induvidually they had an accuracy of 96.5% and 92.5% respectively. 


## Applying symbosis to managerial desicions...


How can this improvements be leveraged in managerial decision-making? 

Some managers are reluctant to use AI systems to aid them in decision making is that they fear it might replace humans. The article is against this idea and outlines 3 different aspects of decision making, uncertainty, complexity and equivocality. Further they make a distinction between analytical and intuitive decision making.



## Analytical 
An analytical approach to problem solving includes methodolical and large data collection and analysis. Finding available decisions and using data to compare them. Reasoning and thougthfulness is necessary to interpret and analytical approach. AI mimics the way "humans use reasoning to draw conclusions from masses of information". An example of an analytical AI tool is Expert systems, which given enough answers to queries can help doctors diagnose patients for example.


## Intuitive
Intuitive decision making is prevalent throughout managerial roles and is not based on information gathering or processing. Intuition can be understood as a "gut-feeling" and is honed by previous experiences, common practices and judgement. It is said that intuition-driven managers can decide without consious attention. Intuition lacks data and can be regarded as a more abstract problem-solving technique. 



### Artificial intelligence, intuition and analytical.

AI tend to be more skewed to be efficient in the analytical aspects as they lack common sense. Uncertainty and unpredictability proves difficult and it is argued that humans bring common sense and overall perform better on intuition-based tasks. That said, AI prove useful in both divisions, but will be discussed as a tool primarily in the analytical sense.

## Uncertainty 
Uncertainty in general means a lack of informaton the situation at hand. There might be unknown factors such as shortage of human resources, new disruptive technologies, competetiors or new policies. These factors affect both humans and AI, AI uses predictive analysis regarding customers assets and operations which help guide human decisionmaking. 

There are some semi-automatic AI in practice at consulting firms such as Deloitte and McKinsey. These systems can be used to detect early warning signs of potentially bigger issues. 

Sometimes in organizational decision making there are no training data for the AI to train on, or the ambiguity is too large, then an intuitive AI-approach is needed. 

Global crisis is mentioned as having few precedents, as well as technical glitches, which complicate the process for an AI. Here again humans excel because of decisions that "feel right".

Apple is mentioned, specifically Steve Jobs for successfully selecting a color palette for the Macintosh seemingly on a whim. A decision that would taken months. However Jobs also had unsuccessful intuition.

Gut feeling, instinct and abstract thinking that "comes from within" is seemingly impossible to simulate with artificial intelligence. **AI cannot mimic human problem solving in these areas.** 

## Complexity

Complex situations are inherently more analytical. They involve large quantities of data and demand large processing power. AI:s are effective at finding causal relationships and finding the correct decisions in large problems in part due to brute force and sheer computing power. 

Recently, AI has via the development within deep learning gained the ability to learn from raw data itself. When there are too much information AI consitency outperform humans. Within those cases, it is important to leverage humans' superior intuition, an example being how to label social media posts. Humans have the final say.

AI “can sift through vast amounts of data to highlight the most interesting things, at which point managers can drill down, using human intelligence, to reach conclusions and take actions.”

##  Equivocality 

As defined in the article:

    "Equivocality refers to the presence of several simultaneous but divergent interpretations of a decision domain"

What it boils down to is to whom should the AI report to. What is *objectively* the best decision and who decides it? Equivocality occurs due to conflicting interests.

That said, the AI is programmed and ensuring the "correct" decision is a task made for humans. Further, humans must be part of the process as an AI is unable to argue with senior management. In chess for example, an objectively optimal move by a computer can look ugly for human players.

Humans are important in organizations, they are competent leaders, visionaries and have the ability to convince employees and stakeholders. It is argued that due to hidden cues, complex social structures, personal relationships and common human behaviour that organizational members will undoubtely having issues following an AI:s order.


## All together now!

The three characteristics (uncertainty, complexity and equivocality) are not mutually exclusive! And approaches are not defined as purely analytical or intuitive. One manager notes that every decision is a combination oof deduction and intuition and that answers cannot be pulled out of "thin air". 


How can the partnership play out?

1. "Humans and AI technologies can collaborate to deal with different aspects of decision-making. AI is likely to be well positioned to tackle complexity issues (using analytical approaches) allowing humans to focus more on uncertainty and equivocality, using more creative and intuitive approaches."

2. "As noted, even the most complex decisions, in which AI has a competitive edge, are likely to entail elements of uncertainty and equivocality. Therefore, as Figure 1 indicates, humans continue to play a role in almost all complex situations, as do AI in the face of uncertainty and equivocality."
