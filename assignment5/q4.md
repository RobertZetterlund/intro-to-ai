# 4b) What is the importance of exploration in RL? Explain with an example.

In reinforcement learning the model recieves rewards for performing actions in different states. Let us use the chain as an example.

From state 0 it is possible to perform two actions and recieve awards accordingly:

| s_1      | forward | backward |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| reward   | 0       | 2        |
| s\_(t+1) | 1       | 0        |

To learn the importance of exploration we must also learn the concept of exploatation. Exploatation can be seen as the opposite of exploration and if an agent only were to exploit, it could be simplified as a **greedy** algorithm. In the table above, exploatation means get reward for short term. exploration means "risking" receiving no instant reward for the off chance of receiving it in the future.

Let us illustrate the concept with the entire chain-link example, the table shows the reward for performing actions forward or backward at link *n*.

| link _n_ |     |     |     | forward | backward |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | ------- | -------- |
| 0        |     |     |     | 0       | 2        |
| 1        |     |     |     | 0       | 2        |
| 2        |     |     |     | 0       | 2        |
| 3        |     |     |     | 0       | 2        |
| 4        |     |     |     | 0       | 2        |
| 5        |     |     |     | 10      | 2        |

The maximum reward (10) at one step _t_ is achievable by being at link _5_ and going forward.
