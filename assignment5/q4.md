# 4b) What is the importance of exploration in RL? Explain with an example.

In reinforcement learning the model recieves rewards for performing actions in different states. Let us use the chain as an example.

From state 0 it is possible to perform two actions,

|        | forward | backward |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| reward | 2       | 0        |
